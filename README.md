# Learner persona

Our proposal is not only open to all research disciplines, thematic
areas, geographical locations, and levels of expertise with respect to
data literacy, computational competencies, or statistics knowledge, but
we encourage and rely on diversity.

To illustrate they diversity we expect, we have designed four learner
personas. Writing learner personas for teaching programming is a concept
established by Wilson (2019) and is a crucial step in understanding the
needs and expectations of the participants.

Each persona has general background, relevant prior knowledge or
experience, the learner’s perception of their needs, and any special
considerations.

## Palesa

Palesa is leading a pit latrine emptying business with 20 employees and
6 vacuum trucks in Lusaka, Zambia. She has finished high school and did
an apprenticeship in business administration. She is also a
representative for the Sanitation Workers Association of Sub-Saharan
Africa.

She knows how to set-up a data table using spreadsheet based software.
She tracks all her business information using this software, but has
never had any formal introduction into data organisation in
spreadsheets. When asked to share her data, she shares the relevant
worksheet by email.

She is constantly approached by researchers, consultants, and public
servants about sharing data on the amounts and types of faecal sludge
removed from sanitation systems. While she is willing to share
information, she is frustrated by and tired of follow up questions and
the number of requests. She wants to learn how to give people access to
her data at a central location, so that everyone can access the data
from there.

She is building a house for her family of five with the revenues of her
business. She is juggling many responsibilities and does not have any
time to participate in formal training.

## Yua

Yua is a PhD student in Computer Science at ETH Zurich. She is an active
contributor to open source software packages and has a passion for Open
Science principles.

She is proficient in half a dozen programming languages and uses R and
Python for Data Science tasks. She has an R package for data
visualisation on GitHub, which has received more than 500 stars. Her
best friend works in the WASH sector and she has learned a fair bit
about it. Her great experience and expertise in data cleaning enable her
to decode data structures with minimal metadata.

She wants to use her technical skills to contribute to open communities
and use her experience to support others in becoming more proficient in
using computational tools. The openwashdata community provides the ideal
starting point for her to do that. She also hopes to use the wealth of
data that is opened by the community to advance her Computer Science PhD
research on barriers to computational reproducibility.

She is introverted and prefers to communicate with people online.

## Mandla

Mandla is in his final year of a Master of Science in Urban Planning at
Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda. He is supporting Senior
Researchers at the university in data collection for WASH related
projects and is highly motivated to learn modern data science tools for
his data analysis tasks.

He did well in his high school maths classes, and has watched some free
online courses on using R for data analysis. He is struggling with file
management and has recently lost three months’ worth of data, as his
hard drive was corrupted.

He knows that there is a better way to analyse and manage data, but he
hasn’t found the right material that teaches him the tools that he
needs. He wants to participate in a 12-week course that teaches him the
foundational knowledge and wants to apply the learned skills to support
the openwashdata community in their mission to publish open data.

He doesn’t have money to buy a laptop. He uses the infrastructure at the
university, but during the recent student strike at the university the
computer lab was damaged and is currently closed.

## Asim

Asim has been working at a research institute in Aachen, Germany for 25
years. He holds a PhD and is a group leader with a focus on solid waste
management research. Throughout his career, he has supported more than
100 students and research assistants in their early career research
stages.

He has never written a line of code, but is highly proficient in using
MS Excel. He has a particular fear of sharing data with other
researchers or alongside journal publications, because he believes that
others could judge his practices or may even use his data to write their
own publications.

He is very particular about workflows, file and data management. During
the offboarding process of each employee, he ensures that generated
research data is stored on a long-term archive server, following his
guidelines for directory structure and documentation. He wants to share
this data with the openwashcommunity under the condition that he and
every researcher that was involved in creating the data gets appropriate
credit for their work.

He has three more years until retirement so is reluctant to learn any
new tools and feels very uncomfortable with anything outside his normal
working environment. He needs someone to show him step by step how to
share his research data with the community.
